# CS50p
**Python programs written for Harvard's CS50 free online course.**<br> 
There are 9 weeks in the course (0 to 8). A good bit of Python I already knew from CS50x so for that reason I only completed week 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.<br>
*The file name is what was taught and the number in parentheses in the week number*<br>
